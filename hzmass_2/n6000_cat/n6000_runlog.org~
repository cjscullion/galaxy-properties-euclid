* File list:
** =AOVSED=
File-path containing the spectrum of Vega.

** =FILTERS_RES=
File-path containing the filter transmission functions.

** =FILTERS_FILE=
col 1 = id number for each filter in the FILTER_RES file.
col 2 = corrections to Vega mags from catalog such that $m_{Vega} = m_{cat} + m_{corr}$.
col 3 = rule applied in the case of undetected objects:
0 -> filter will not be taken into account.

1 -> flux in this filter is set to $F_{obs} = 0$ with error corresponding to the flux deduced from the limiting mag in the fourth column i.e. $\Delta F_{obs} = F_{lim}$.

2 -> flux in this filter and the associated $1 \sigma$ error are set to $F_{lim}/2$.

3 -> flux in this filter and the associated error are computed from the limiting mag $m_{lim}$ an from the error $\Delta m_{lim}$ given in columns four and five.

We have already filtered out objects with 'undetected' magnitudes, so it shouldn't matter what we choose. But let's choose 1.
 
** =TEMPLATES_FILE=
File-path to the file which contains further file-paths to the templates. 

** =CATALOG_FILE=


** =OUTPUT_FILE=


** =SED_OBS_FILE, SED_TEMP_FILE, LOGPHOT_FILE, ZPHOT_FILE, CATPHOT_FILE=
*** =OUTPUT_FILE.obs_sed=
The observed SEDs, given as the mean integreated fluxes through the photometric system, and the corresponding errors.
