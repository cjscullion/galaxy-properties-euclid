# galaxy-properties-euclid
A repository for the continuation and documentation of my project work on Galaxy Physical Properties in View of Euclid - an ESA mission.
Since I'm new to git, I thought it would be a good idea to begin by creating a repository with some of my current work on it to test it out. I intend to use it as a little bit of version control. Granted, this isn't super necessary for this project, but it will provide me with a way to get used to the workflow here and see if it suits me.
I'll also be using github as a platform to share my work online for ease of access. Hopefully I can work on making it easy to navigate. Any feedback there is appreciated (any feedback at all is appreciated!!). 

## Project Outline
The basic idea is to assess the affect of filter set on the resolution of physical paramters using currently adopted workflows. Primarily, we use Hyperz here: an SED fitting code, and a variety of customised versions of the software. I then process the results in .ipynb's typically, and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the fitting parameters (inc. filter set) based on the accuracy of physical parameter outputs vs. the actual mock galaxy recipe physics.

So far we find that in processing it can sometimes be effective to drop the photometric contributions from the LSST u band, as it appears to cause complications at high rest-frame due to what we believe is the outshining phenomenon.

I'll be adding more here soon in my efforts to clean up this repo.
