# galaxy-properties-euclid
A first github repository for the continuation and documentation of my project work on Galaxy Physical Properties in View of Euclid - an ESA mission.
Since I'm new to git, I thought it would be a good idea to begin by creating a repository with some of my current work on it to test it out. I intend to use it as a little bit of version control. Granted, this isn't super necessary for this project, but it will provide me with a way to get used to the workflow here and see if it suits me.
I'll also be using github as a platform to share my work online for ease of access. Hopefully I can work on making it easy to navigate. Any feedback there is appreciated (any feedback at all is appreciated!!).
