# galaxy-properties-euclid
A first github repository for the continuation and documentation of my project work on Galaxy Physical Properties in View of Euclid - an ESA mission.
Since I'm new to git, I thought it would be a good idea to begin by creating a repository with some of my current work on it to test it out. I intend to use it as a little bit of version control. Granted, this isn't super necessary for this project, but it will provide me with a way to get used to the workflow here and see if it suits me.
I'll also be using github as a platform to share my work online for ease of access. Hopefully I can work on making it easy to navigate. Any feedback there is appreciated (any feedback at all is appreciated!!). 
## Hyperz results
4051_results.ipynb represents my most up-to-date work analysing the output of hyperz.

hz_results.ipynb is a WIP, and isn't really very presentable. However, I'm uploading it here in case anyone is interested in seeing some results before I make the notebooks look pretty.
## SFH replication
Work on how well SFHs are resolved using Hyperz is found in SFH_resolution. There you will find a .ipynb which shows the code and comments I made in this work, as well as larger, downloadable versions of any figures created. I'll try to keep adding figures alongside .ipynb's since that's mostly how I work. It seems .ipynb's are a little tempramental in github so I'm adding a .md version too just in case.
